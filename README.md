## Summary

This proposal adds two new math opcodes to the Bitcoin Cash Virtual Machine (BCH VM), `op_muldiv` and `op_mulmod`.

`op_muldiv` greatly simplifies contracts using 64-bit integer multiplication in intermediate calculations.
These calculations currently fail on overflow so contract authors need to either restrict input ranges or use clever math workarounds which sacrifice precision.

`op_muldiv` presents a clean alternative to this and together with `op_mulmod` it paves the way for emulating higher precision math in BCH contracts.

## Deployment

Deployment of this specification is proposed for the May 2024 upgrade.

## Motivation

Bitcoin Cash has upgraded to 64-bit integers and now with the advent of CashTokens the BCH VM enables complex applications,
this poses the need both for higher-order math and for allowing overflows in intermediate calculations.

Now, shortly after the CashTokens upgrade there are already multiple different Constant ProductMarket Maker (CPMM) contracts live on the network 
which carefully have to consider strategies for multiplication overflows.
The composite aritmathic opcode `op_muldiv` allows the intermediate calculation to overflow and hence simplifies the strategies dealing with overflows,
leading to simpler, more efficient and more capable smart contracts.

Moreover, the introduction of `op_muldiv` and `op_mulmod` is a big step towards enabling emulation of higher precision math (uint126) in BCH contracts.

## Benefits

By introducing these opcodes, the code for advanced contracts such as AMMs can be improved in multiple dimensions and 
more advanced contracts using higher-order math emulation are enabled.

### Simpler, More Efficient & More Capable Contracts

There are two overflow strategies for contracts using mutiplication in an intermediate step: 
- Restrict the range of the coefficients so they can be guaranteed not to overflow 
- Use modulo math to approximate the end result of the calculation

In the former case, the introduction of `op_muldiv` would allow contract authors to expand the ranges of allowed coefficients easily.
In the latter  case, the introduction of `op_muldiv` would allow contract authors to simplify their contract by getting rid of the 
modulo math workaround and instead use the native functionality. This would make the contract simpler (less error-prone) and more efficient
both in terms of opcodes and bytesize.

[Cauldron DEX](https://www.cauldron.quest/) is an example of the first strategy and [Fex.cash](https://fex.cash/) of the second one.
Both projects would benefit from having the option to utilize `op_muldiv` in a future version.
Even UniSwap V3 makes heavy use of a [`muldiv` helperfunction](https://docs.uniswap.org/contracts/v3/reference/core/libraries/FullMath) and has [taken initiative](https://ethereum-magicians.org/t/create-a-new-opcode-for-muldiv/8574) to get an `muldiv` opcode added to the EVM.

### Higher Precision Math

With `op_muldiv` and `op_mulmod` the result of a multiplication of two 64-bit integers can be represented as a uint126 by using two 64-bit integers
(as demonstrated [here](https://medium.com/wicketh/mathemagic-full-multiply-27650fec525d)).
The addition and subtraction of two uint126 numbers would require a workaround for overflows which involves masking the highest bit and adding up the resulting int62s. This way uint126 addition and subtraction is already possible without loss of precision but for division of an uint126 the 
[CHIP-2021-05-loops: Bounded Looping Operations](https://github.com/bitjson/bch-loops) is required in addition to `op_muldiv` to make it practical
(as demonstrated [here](https://medium.com/wicketh/mathemagic-512-bit-division-in-solidity-afa55870a65)).

The two new composite aritmatic opcodes serve as primitives for building user-space libraries that enable higher order (uint126) math.
CashScript is investigating [enabling support for libraries/macros](https://github.com/CashScript/cashscript/issues/153) so a user-space library for 
uint126 math could be built and utilized by other contracts.

### Easy overflow check

If a contract has conditional logic for when a calculations would overflow, this condition can be easily check using `op_muldiv` by using the maximum integer as divisor. Then the result return a number `!=0` on overflow and `0` otherwise. 

## Costs & Risk Mitigation

The following costs and risks have been assessed.

### Modification to Transaction Validation

Modifications to VM limits have the potential to increase worst-case transaction validation costs and expose VM implementations to Denial of Service (DOS) attacks.

**Mitigations**: A simple arithmetic sequence such as multiplying-dividing or multiplying-modulo should have no impact on worst-case transaction validation costs 
and the DOS-attack surface.  


### Node Upgrade Costs
 
This proposal affects consensus â€“ all fully-validating node software must implement these VM changes to remain in consensus.

These VM changes are backwards-compatible: all past and currently-possible transactions remain valid under these new rules.

### Ecosystem Upgrade Costs

Because this proposal only affects internals of the VM, standard wallets, block explorers, and other services will not require software modifications for these changes. Only software which offers emulation of VM evaluation (e.g. [Bitauth IDE](https://github.com/bitauth/bitauth-ide)) will be required to upgrade.

Wallets and other services may also upgrade to add support for new contracts which will become possible after deployment of this proposal.

## Technical Specification

There are two free adjecent codepoints available of the disabled `op_2mul` and `op_2div`, these are proposed to be used instead for `op_muldiv` and `op_mulmod` :

|Word|Value|Hex|Input|Output|Description|
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
|OP_MULDIV|141|0x8d|a b c|out|*a* is first multiplied by *b* then divided by *c* and the quotient of the division is returned. The intermediate product CAN be in the INT128 range, while the quotient MUST be in the INT64 range. Sign is preserved and *c* MUST be a non-zero value.|
|OP_MULMOD|142|0x8e|a b c|out|*a* is first multiplied by *b* then divided by *c* and the modulus of the division is returned. The intermediate product CAN be in the INT128 range, while the modulus MUST be in the INT64 range. Sign is preserved and *c* MUST be a non-zero value.|

## Rationale

This section documents design decisions made in this specification.

### Complete set of composite operations for overflows

Only the composite aritmatic opcodes `op_muldiv` and `op_mulmod` are proposed as those are immediately useful. Other composite arithmetic functionality (`adddiv`, `addmod`, `subdiv` and `subdiv`) is very useful in simplifying uint126 math and in enabling easy overflow checks. However the number of cases where addition or subtraction overflows are much smaller than for multiplication, and it is possible to workaround the overflow without losing precision.

Alternatives include reserving 6 codepoints or starting with a shared codepoint right away for all composite operations.

## Evaluation of Alternatives

### Larger integers

An alternative solution for solving the overflow problem of 64-bit integer calculations is to simply extend the integer length.
However, even with larger integers there would still be a need for emulation ofhigher precision math.
This is illustrated by UniSwap V3 making good use using a `MulDiv` helperfunction despite the 256-bit integer precision of the EVM.
UniSwap can emulate `MulDiv` functionality with the native `mulmod` EVM opcode, it also makes use of the fact that the Ethereum math opcodes
such as multiplication do allow for overflow and return the higher-order bits.

If Bitcoin Cash upgrades to larger integers (e.g. 128-bit), then `op_muldiv` and `op_mulmod` should also use this same level of precision for the result
while allowing intermediate multiplication up to double the size (256-bit).
